# full_stack_app


Final project 10 for Treehouse 

In this final project, a full-stack React app is created that connects with an existing school database REST API (project 9). The full stack application provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. 

Tools used: React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.
